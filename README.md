## DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is a real estate website focusing on luxury properties like penthouses, beachfront estates, and private islands. The website will have a unique design and user interface. Users can browse estates through an interactive slider and search by category. Each estate listing will include details like photos, descriptions, prices, locations, and amenities. Clicking "View Property" takes users to a detailed property page with more information and visuals.

The website utilizes user authentication through email and password or social media logins. Logged-in users can view and update their profile information, including name and profile picture. Secure Firebase authentication protects user data and ensures only logged-in users can access their profile and view details on specific estates (protected route).

## FEATURES & SOLUTIONS
